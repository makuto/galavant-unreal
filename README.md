# galavant-unreal
A Galavant front-end using Unreal Engine 4

This will be a really messy project doing various testing/experimentation.

This project depends on 
1. [Galavant](https://github.com/makuto/galavant), which should be cloned into galavant-unreal/GalavantUnreal/ThirdParty/galavant (or use a symlink)
2. [PolyVox](https://bitbucket.org/volumesoffun/polyvox), which should be cloned into galavant-unreal/GalavantUnreal/ThirdParty/polyvox
