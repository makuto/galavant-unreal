# galavant-unreal

A Galavant front-end using Unreal Engine 4

This will be a really messy project doing various testing/experimentation.

## Dependencies

This project depends on 
1. [Galavant](https://github.com/makuto/galavant), which should be cloned into galavant-unreal/GalavantUnreal/ThirdParty/galavant (or use a symlink) (MIT License)
2. [PolyVox](https://bitbucket.org/volumesoffun/polyvox), which should be cloned into galavant-unreal/GalavantUnreal/ThirdParty/polyvox (pseudo-public domain)

## Building

This section is WIP.

### Unreal Engine Code Modifications

Galavant requires some modifications to the UE4 code. These can be found in Source/UnrealEnginePatches and can be applied using git. (TODO: Make this process convenient)
